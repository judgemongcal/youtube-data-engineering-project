# youtube-data-engineering-project

## Introduction
This project is a YouTube Data Engineering pipeline built on AWS, designed to process and analyze trending video data at scale for the Canada (CA), United Kingdom (GB), and United States (US) regions. The pipeline automates data ingestion, transformation, and storage, enabling efficient querying, analysis, and reporting of YouTube trends.

As an added feature, a Tableau dashboard is included to provide visual insights into the processed data. The dashboard allows users to explore trends in viewer engagement, video performance, and category-level statistics, offering a more interactive way to interpret and communicate findings.
